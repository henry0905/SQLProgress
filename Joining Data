--- INNER JOIN
SELECT left.id as match_id,
left.field as data1,
right.field as data2,
FROM left_table AS left
INNER JOIN right_table as right
USING (id);

--- BASIC EXAMPLE
SELECT c.code AS country_code, c.name, e.year, e.inflation_rate
FROM countries AS c
  -- Join to economies (alias e)
  INNER JOIN economies as e
    -- Match on code
    ON e.code = c.code;
 
    -- Or we can use
    USING (code);
